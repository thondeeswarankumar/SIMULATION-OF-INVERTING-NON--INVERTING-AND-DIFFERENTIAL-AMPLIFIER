# SIMULATION-OF-INVERTING-NON--INVERTING-AND-DIFFERENTIAL-AMPLIFIER

## AIM: 
To Design and simulate a inverting, non- inverting and differential amplifiers using LT-Spice.
SOFTWARE REQUIRED: 
                         LT-Spice
## PROCEDURE:
1.	Double click on LT-Spice icon.
2.	New schematic window open.
3.	Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram.
4.	Complete the connection.
5.	Save the file by giving file name.
6.	Click on the run option ->click advanced open ->select Ac analysis->enter the amplitude time delay stop time value.
7. Click on the run option ->simulation window opens->place the probe ->output graph is obtained.
